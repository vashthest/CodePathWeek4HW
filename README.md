#### Required
* [x] Tapping on a photo in the news feed should expand the photo full screen.
* [x] Tapping the Done button should animate the photo back into its position in the news feed.
* [x] On scroll of the full screen photo, the background should start to become transparent, revealing the feed.
* [x] If the user scrolls a large amount and releases, the full screen photo should dismiss.

#### Optional
* [x] Optional: The full screen photo should be zoomable.
* [x] Optional: The user should be able to page through the other photos in full screen mode.

Notes
- 

- While you can page through the other photos in the full screen mode, it totally screws up the zoom side of things. Is the expectation that you'd have to literally turn off pagination and then code up the zoom logic and where the bounds are of the current view and how it pages to the next photo all manually? It doesn't seem like XCode gives you that stuff for free.
